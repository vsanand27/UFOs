Develop a working website to view UFO sightings around United States of America and review latest article on UFO sightings.  The dataset used in Key and Pair values similar to data dictionaries in Python. 

The key of this website is to display dataset in a dynamic table and be able to filter based on multiple parameters.  This is an exercise for data scientist and analyst to present management a tool to review data and share analysis.

Source HTML: https://github.com/vsanand27/UFOs/blob/master/index.html

To display – open in visual studio and right click to open in Terminal or Live Server

JavaScript with table/filter functions: https://github.com/vsanand27/UFOs/blob/master/static/js/app.js

CSS for bootstrap format: https://github.com/vsanand27/UFOs/blob/master/static/css/style.css

# Design Phase 

Majority OPEX Expenses – ASC 350 Internal Use Software - Until Proof of Concept

•	Developed a design layout of the website

•	Map design layout into rows and columns format and bootstrap functions to be used

•	Develop project timeline, resource planning, and project schedule

•	Obtain datasets for UFO Sightings, images and articles used for the website

# Development 
CAPEX Expense to amortized based on life of an asset

•	Create HTML file for Web Layout, JavaScript for table/filter functions and CSS

•	Perform Data Cleansing: Inspect, Clean and exclude values for incorrect datasets 

•	Develop HTML file, also insert bootstrap function to show filters, forms etc.

•	Apply Website Filters: Apply 5 filter to Date/time, City, State, Country and Shape

•	Develop JavaScript with three functions:

•	Create CSS file to change website formatting for bootstrap and text alignment

•	Trouble-shoot issue utilizing Chrome web browser console

# Deployment 
CAPEX/OPEX Expense

•	Upload to Git Hub code for use (CAPEX)

•	Training (OPEX)

•	Support (OPEX)

•	Enhancement (CAPEX based on Company Threshold)

# Recommendations: 
1)	Utilize bootstrap to show drop-down values to enhance website capability

2)	Show Input filter values by user As a string above the table
