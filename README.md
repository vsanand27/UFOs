Source HTML: 
To display – open in visual studio and right click to open in Terminal or Live Server

JavaScript with table/filter functions:
CSS for bootstrap format: 
Steps Taken: Automatic Table and Date Search

# Design Phase 
Majority OPEX Expenses – ASC 350 Internal Use Software - Until Proof of Concept
•	Developed a design layout of the website
•	Map design layout into rows and columns format and bootstrap functions to be used
•	Develop project timeline, resource planning, and project schedule

•	Create CSS file to change website formatting for bootstrap and text alignment
•	Trouble-shoot issue utilizing Chrome web browser console
# Deployment 
CAPEX/OPEX Expense
•	Upload to Git Hub code for use (CAPEX)
•	Training (OPEX)
•	Support (OPEX)
•	Enhancement (CAPEX based on Company Threshold)
# Recommendations: 
1)	Utilize bootstrap to show drop-down values to enhance website capability
2)	Show Input filter values by user As a string above the table
